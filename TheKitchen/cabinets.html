            cabinet material you love. Not sure which wood is best for your kitchen needs? Use this<br />

            <h4>Maple:</h4>
            <p>
                This wood is very popular for modern custom kitchen designs since its light color makes it easy to stain.<br />
                The grain of maple wood cabinets is also light, so it looks smooth and uniform in your kitchen from afar.
            </p>
            <h4>Cherry:</h4>
            <p>
                A durable option for families with children, cherry wood cabinets can stand up to most wear and tear.<br />
                This type of wood kitchen cabinets’ color is originally a lighter red or brown, but it gets darker with time.
            </p>
            <h4>White Oak:</h4>
            <p>
                The stronger of the oaks, this wood has a rustic, cozy feel. Using white oak wood for your kitchen <br />
                is another popular choice for custom modern kitchen cabinets and has a soft grain to it.
            </p>
            <h4>Red Oak:</h4>
            <p>
                Red oak is versatile, as it takes well too many types of finishes. Its bold grain gives it<br />
                a more woody look in your kitchen space than the previous options, so it is often used for<br />
                more transitional or even traditional style kitchen designs.
            </p>
            <h4>Ash:</h4>
            <p>
                Ash is a clean wood cabinet material with an even grain. It can be customized with the<br />
                right finish to look contemporary and crisp, giving your modern kitchen an original feel.
            </p>
            <h4>Pine:</h4>
            <p>
                Remember that pine is a softwood, so it is generally speaking less durable than hardwood<br />
                options in your modern Italian kitchen. It is light in color, making it easy to stain,<br />
                and it also displays tree knots throughout the cabinet doors. Much like red oak, pine <br />
                is more commonly found in transitional kitchens.
            </p>
            <h4>Birch:</h4>
            <p>
                The birch tree has a luxurious look to it, taking on a variety of colors. Birch<br />
                has a fine grain and is highly durable, which makes it a preferred material for <br />
                kitchen projects. It also has a smooth surface that may change color with age.
