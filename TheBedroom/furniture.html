    <h1>7 Tips for Bedroom Furniture</h1>
    <img id="main" src="https://www.thatscandinavianfeeling.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cozy_bedroom_hygge_unmade_bed.jpg" alt="cozy bedroom" />
    <p>
        A bedroom should be a personal getaway, a sanctuary, which expresses your favorite colors,<br />
        feelings, and collections. Learn the main rules to remember when decorating your bedroom.
    </p><hr />

    <h3>1. Keep the Bedroom Simple</h3>
    <p>
        A bedroom should look cozy and simple, sophisticated, and elegant, regardless of what style<br />
        of decorating you choose. For ease of movement, leave a minimum of three feet between the bed<br />
        and side walls or large pieces of furniture and at least two feet between the bed and low furniture,<br />
        like tables and dressers. If you have to walk around the bed to get from the closet to the bathroom,<br />
        think of how you can move the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furnish your bedroom with only what you need. A bed, a bedside table or two, a dresser, and chair<br />
        are necessities. Anything else is clutter. If you have room, place a chest of drawers in the closet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accessories should be kept to a minimum. Choose a beautiful piece of artwork, arrange<br />
        some family photos, add flowers and candles, and leave it alone.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Choose the Right Size Furniture</h3>
    <p>
        When you're ready to buy bedroom furniture, start out with a floor plan and a measured drawing<br />
        of the space. Furniture should fit the room it lives and this is particularly true for bedroom<br />
        furniture. Don't choose a heavy, large bed and dresser for a small bedroom. If the ceiling is<br />
        high, a tall headboard will help to visibly bring it down to size.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your bedroom is large, choose furniture that fits it, too. Add a chair and ottoman or place a<br />
        piece of furniture at the end of the bed. Furniture and accessories that are too small will look lost in a large room.

    <h3>3. Have Plenty of Storage</h3>
    <p>
        To add to the serene feeling of a bedroom, store things out of sight. The room will appear more calm and roomy.<br />
        Choose a roomy bedside table with drawers or doors behind which you can hide books, lotion, and reading glasses<br />
        within reach but out of sight. For more storage, choose a skirted table or a small dresser with drawers.<br />
        Use a trunk or a storage bench at the foot of the bed to store extra sheets, blankets, and pillows.<br />
        For easily-reachable books and accessories, use a headboard with built-in shelves or sliding panels.<br />
        A custom-designed organization system can make maximum use of closet space.<br />
        Place shallow boxes underneath the bed hiding them with a beautiful bed skirt.<br />

    <h3>4. Include a Private Nook</h3>
    <p>
        Give yourself a special gift with a quiet place to sit and read. Create an intimate reading or lounging area with<br />
        a comfortable chair and footstool at the end of your bed or in a corner.<br /><br />

        If you have room, build a window seat under the bedroom window. Enjoy the view and the natural light.

    <h3>5. Cover the Windows</h3>
    <p>
        A beautifully dressed window will help to frame the window and the view and provide other ways to add<br />
        color, pattern, texture, and softness to a bedroom. If you love soft sheer curtains that filter light,<br />
        combine opaque roller blinds that can be pulled down to maintain privacy at night and to block morning light.<br /><br />

        For all draperies, include opaque blinds or drapery lining to keep out the sun when you want to sleep late.<br />

    <h3>6. Include Several Lighting Options</h3>
    <p>
        In a bedroom, it's good to "layer" your lighting throughout the room. Ambient lighting light the whole room,<br />
        small lamps can focus light for reading and other activities, and accent light helps to wash the walls in soft illumination.<br /><br />

        To focus reading light where you need it, use a bedside lamp with a movable arm. Each light should be adjustable<br />
        with a dimmer. Install a separate on/off switch for each light so that you can be selective and light only the area you want.

    <h3>7. Let Your Bedroom Be a Real Getaway</h3>
    Try to discipline yourself to keep your cell phone, computer, television, or exercise machine out of the bedroom.<br />
    Create a cherished place to relax and renew. You'll love having a room dedicated to reading, sleeping, and relaxing.<br /><br />
