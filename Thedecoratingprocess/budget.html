        <h1>Making and Sticking to a budget</h1>
        <section>
            Developing an interior design budget on your own isn’t easy. There is SO much that goes into each one, from products<br />
            to labor to shipping to taxes and beyond…  But a well thought-out budget is critical to a successful design<br />
            project!Today, I’m going to walk you through how we develop design budgets with our clients. This should give you<br />
            clarity and a good foundation for doing the same on your own — or coming prepared when you meet up with us!<br /><br />

            <div class="head">1. CREATE YOUR <p class="special">design concept</p></div>
            A design budget starts with your vision for the space. We ask you to gather inspirational images that represent<br />
            what you’d like to see.Are we installing a wall of built-ins? Looking at classic subway tile or a laser cut mosaic<br />
            on your backsplash? Envisioning layered draperies or clean solar shades? Are you drawn to minimalistic, maximalistic<br />
            or somewhere in between? You’d be surprised how stacks of books and layers of accessories add up. These questions<br />
            are important, and all need to be factored into the budget.<br /><br />

            <div class="head">
                2. DEVELOP A DETAILED
                <p class="special">space plan</p>
            </div>
            We develop detailed space plans to determine how many pieces we need in the space, and we look at ALL the details.<br />
            Are we thinking of a larger area rug with a smaller accent rug layered on top? What’s going on the surfaces?<br />
            Lamps, Trays? Are we using plants or trees in the space? If so, we need to add these (and their pots) to the list.<br /><br />

            <div class="head">3. THINK ABOUT THE <p class="special">quality </p>YOU WANT IN YOUR HOME</div>
            Think about the QUALITY and DURABILITY of what you want in your home. Do you have kids and need a performance fabric<br />
            (Crypton) on your upholstery? Do you have furniture that will be in full sun and should fight fading (Sunbrella)?<br />
            These specialty fabrics all cost a premium, but have important roles in creating a space that lasts. BID Tip: You can<br />
            see which brands of furniture had and liked in the past. Lift up the sofa or chair cushion and the brand will often<br />
            be on a label. Or, on the underside of casegoods.<br /><br />

            Remember that you can only pick two!<br />

            <img style="margin:auto;" src="https://www.blakelyinteriordesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ORQ4cxj7-294x300.png" alt="good fast and cheap" /><br />

            You can only pick two. Choosing something that's cheap and fast will not be good, something good and fast will<br />
            not be cheap, and something good and cheap will not be fast. You got the picture.<br /><br />


            <div class="head">5. CREATE A <p class="special">detailed list </p>OF PRODUCTS AND NEEDS</div>
            We then take your space plans or furniture plans and make a detailed list in Excel. There are <br />
            online templates available, but you can also do this by hand if that’s your jam.<br />
            Each spreadsheet has columns for Good, Better, Best (or Low, Mid, High), and we add price points for<br />
            each line item in each price category. You can use Google to research product prices. For example, take<br />
            your dining chairs… depending on the design concept, you should already know if these chairs are going<br />
            to be fully upholstered, fully wooden, or just an upholstered seat. This LARGELY impacts budget!<br />
            BID Tip: Don’t forget these often overlooked items! Drapery hardware, wall art (this is big!), rug pads,<br />
            pillows, duvet inserts, wallpaper, plants, etc.<br /><br />

            <div class="head">
                6. ADD UP EACH PRICE COLUMN FOR A
                <p class="special">subtotal</p>
            </div>
            When you add up each price column, you’ll quickly see the bare minimum needed to execute your vision. But wait!<br />
            There are other costs you need to consider, too…<br />

            <ul class="cost">
                <li>Tax!</li>
                <li>Shipping/freight costs (assume an average of ~10%-12%)</li>
                <li>Installation charges for wallpaper, window treatments, etc.</li>
                <li>
                    ACCESSORIES!! These add up and should not be overlooked. On average, <br />
                    estimate 10%-20% of the subtotal cost but absolutely no less than 7%. That<br />
                    cocktail table NEEDS items to feel finished!
                </li>
                <li>Built-Ins or millwork needed</li>
                <li>
                    If you’re working through a design firm, there is also a receiving warehouse<br />
                    and delivery fee… though it is worth its weight in gold, as they receive and inspect<br />
                    every single item, eliminating the need for you to be home constantly and deal with claims<br />
                    on any damaged goods.
                </li>
                <li>That’s it! You’ll see that it adds up quickly.</li>
            </ul><br />

            My Advice: Limit your scope and do a single area well versus trying to do everything at once. If your budget can’t<br />
            really support the quality you’d like, save the dining room for next fall and do the family room really well now.<br />
