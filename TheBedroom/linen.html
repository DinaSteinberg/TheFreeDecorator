    <h1>The Linen</h1>
    Being that we spend about one-third of our lives asleep, it makes sense to invest<br />
    in bedding that's not only comfortable, but stands the test of time. But with so<br />
    many options out there — thread count, fabric make-up, patterns, solids — the<br />
    decision process can be overwhelming. We got DwellStudio founder and all around<br />
    bedding expert Christiane Lemieux's tips to help simply the process.

    <ol>

        <li> Thread Count<br />

            Thread count isn't an indication of quality anymore. Unless it's an amazing and very<br />
            expensive fabric, a high thread count is just a numbers game: many companies cheat the<br />
            numbers with double twist yarns in a cheaper fabric. "Personally, I prefer a 400 single<br />
            pick percale sheet because of the crisp, cool feel. But if you like a soft, warm, bed,<br />
            a great stretchy jersey sheet might be your thing, and that's not about thread count at<br />
            all," Lemieux says.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Material<br />

            The type of material you choose for your sheets has everything to do with personal <br />
            preference. Think about it: it's what you're wearing eight hours a day.

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <b>Cotton:</b> <br />
                    The best quality (and most <br />
                    expensive) is 100% Egyptian,<br />
                    which has extra-long-staple<br />
                    fibers that produce sumptuous,<br />
                    yet extremely durable sheets.<br />
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <b>Pima or Supima cotton:</b><br />
                    A medium-to-extra-long staple fibers<br />
                    material, is known for its softness<br />
                    and sheen and is a little more<br />
                    affordable than Egyptian cotton.<br>
                </td>

                <td><img class="materials" src="https://www.thesleepjudge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/supima-sheet-closeup.jpg" alt="pima cotton" /></td>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <b>Linen:</b><br />
                    Ideal for hot climates, linen sheets<br />
                    are some of the most expensive out<br />
                    there, but will last for decades.<br />
                    For an already worn-in look and <br />
                    feel, "I love all the enzyme-washed<br />
                    linens on the market right now,"<br />
                    Lemieux says. "They're soft and <br />
                    durable, and improve with age."<br />
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td><b>Poly-blend sheets:</b><br />
                Easy and resistant to wrinkles.</td>

            </table><br />
        </li>

        <li> Weave<br />

            The way sheets are woven have a direct impact on how they feel. Lemieux's fave, percale, is lightweight and<br />
            tightly woven, which results in crisp, cool, bedding, while microfiber's super-tight, dense weave makes<br />
            it wrinkle-resistant, extra-soft, and resistant to water.<br /><br />
        <h4>Percale:</h4>

            Some other weaves to consider: ultra-soft and lustrous sateen, and flannel, with a nappy texture perfect for cooler climates.<br /><br />
        <h4>Sateen:</h4>

        </li>
        <li>Pattern<br />

            Like any other element in the bedroom, sheets play a part in the overall design. "I always advise a small,<br />
            medium, and large scale mix of patterns in the same color family," Lemieux says. "It's an easy way to start<br />
            experimenting with prints."<br /><br />

        </li>
        <li>Seasonality<br />

            How many sheet sets you need is totally up to you and how often you like to change things up. But remember,<br />
            sheets that may seem summery can work all year. Just add a coverlet, blanket, and throw to make your bed cozier<br />
            for the fall and winter months.<br /><br />
