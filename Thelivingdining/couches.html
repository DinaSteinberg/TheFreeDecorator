        <h1>Choosing The Right Couch For You</h1>
        <p>
            Couch decisions can seem overwhelming if you have no concept of materials, stuffing, dimensions,<br />
            etc. But this is a pretty important decision because how often do you buy a couch? Be careful and<br />
            thoughtful about your choices. Below is a list of things you should consider when looking into buying<br />
            a couch, but there's definitely a lot that wasn't covered here. Consult experts in the field and ask <br />
            around for ideas of good couches. Also, you probably have some experiences with couches. Think of all<br />
            the sofas you've had over your life, and write a list of the qualities that you liked the best from all <br />
            of the couches. This should help give you a good starting point.

            <h4>What Types of Arms Are Cool?</h4>
            <p>
                Generally, the rounder the arm, the more traditional the sofa. For a modern pick<br />
                that’s also pretty timeless, try a tuxedo-style sofa, which has straight arms the<br />
                same height as the sofa’s back, says designer Elaine Griffin. “It’s the LBD of<br />
                upholstered seating—it meshes well with any style of room.”
            </p>

            <h4>Sectional or Stand-Alone? I Can’t Decide.</h4>
            <p>
                Think about your intentions for the space. If it’s more of a formal living<br />
                room — a stylish spot for occasional entertaining, you’re better off with a stand-alone<br />
                sofa, which has a sleeker, cleaner line. A sectional is so roomy and inviting that<br />
                it tends to scream casual (great for lounging, watching TV, napping, or playing games<br />
                around the coffee table).
            </p>

            <h4>I’ve Got Kids and Pets. What Fabric Should I Choose?</h4>

            <p>
                “Cotton velvet is essentially no-fail. It’s plush and wears well,” says designer Young Huh.<br />
                “Go with a stain-camouflaging pattern in a dark color if you don’t want a ‘no eating on the<br />
                couch’ rule in your house.” Avoid chenille, which stretches and warps over time.
            </p>

            <h4>Foam or Feather Filling? What’s the Difference?</h4>

            <p>
                A mix is ideal. Instead of all-down (expensive, prone to looking lumpy) or all-foam<br />
                (resilient but stiff-feeling), try foam-core cushions with feather wraps, says Huh.<br />
                “This strikes just the right balance between structure and plushness, and it’s also an<br />
                affordable pick.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Tip: Tape it out. Before you buy, use blue painter’s tape to “draw” the height, length, and<br />
                depth right into your living room. This is the best way to check size, says Huh, especially if<br />
                you fill the outline with empty cardboard boxes, which will give you a true sense of the heft<br />
                of the piece. Don’t forget to make sure your dream sofa will fit through doorways and halls on<br />
                its way to its intended spot—particularly if you live in an apartment or an older home with small<br />
                passageways.
            </p>

            <h4>I Have a Small Amount of Wall Space.</h4>

            <p>
                Resist the love seat. It’s meant to seat two, but since it’s only 60 inches wide, that never really<br />
                happens. “Two people have to be truly in love to sit together on one,” quips Griffin. Instead, try<br />
                the decorators’ go-to: a 72-inch “apartment-size” sofa. “It seats two average-size people and is<br />
                long enough for napping.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Tip: If you’re buying a couch that’s seven feet long or less, choose a single-cushion style, <br />
                decorator Chris Barrett. “It’s elegant, and no one has to sit on a crack.”
            </p>

            <h4>Seat Depth is Everything</h4>

            <p>
                It's the difference between a couch you can slouch into for movie night and one that you (and friends)<br />
                can sit upright in while chatting over cocktails. Overall depth is less important than the dimension<br />
                from the front of the seat cushion to the front of the back pillow. Here, a cheat sheet:
            </p>
            <ul class="outer">
                <li>
                    18 Inches Deep: Looks cool and modern, but nobody will call this cozy.<br />
                    You can use this in your:
                    <ul class="inner">
                        <li>Living room, around the coffe table.</li>
                        <li>Office</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


                <li>
                    22 Inches Deep: Minimum depth for sitting comfortably, but still sleek.<br />
                    You can use this in your:
                    <ul class="inner">
                        <li>Living room</li>
                        <li>Reading nook</li>
                        <li>Playroom</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    24 Inches Deep: Just deep enough for lying down (solo).<br />
                    You can use this in your:
                    <ul class="inner">
                        <li>Living room. Mmmm</li>
                        <li>Bedroom</li>
                        <li>Den</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    33 Inches Deep: That sink-into-it feel that makes you say, “Maybe I'll just sleep here tonight.”<br />
                    You can use this in your:
                    <ul class="inner">
                        <li>Living room</li>
                        <li>Den</li>
                        <li>Really anywhere!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
