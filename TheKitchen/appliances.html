    <article>
        <p>
            It's late at night and you're still up trying to finish that last little thing. After your third<br />
            yawn in a row, you decide you need a little sugar boost to keep you going just a bit more. You amble<br />
            over to the fridge and grope around for something sugary. And then you stop. Something slimy and<br />
            gloopy covers your hand, and you hurry to wipe the repulsive slime from your hand. Well thatdefinitely<br />
            woke you up.<br /><br />
            If you can relate to the story above, you're definitely not alone. But why shuold it stay like this?<br />
            There are so many available resources to help you easily organize your kitchen! Below, you'll find<br />
            some of these helpful items that once you get, you'll wonder how you managed without.
        </p>
        <h2>The thin pull-out spice cabinet</h2>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1592938017-tight-space-shelf-1592938005.jpg?crop=0.8xw:1xh;center,top&resize=768:*" alt="pull out shelf" />
        <p>
            As you install your cabinets, if you find that some cabinets are just too wide, make it just 5 inches<br />
            thinner and add this handy dandy spice organizer. It's convenient, and saves you the overwhelming task<br />
            of trying to take out one spice without having them all fall on your head. This is a good alternative<br />
            to swivel spice cabinets because, A) You can see all your spices at once with this pull-out cabinet,<br />
            and B)It takes up much less room, room that's not used anyways.
        </p><hr />
        <h2>Corner cabinets</h2>
        <img src="https://www.rockler.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5c5edcf249a74e99ece620285918bb9b/6/5/65234-01.jpg" alt="pull out corner" />
        <p>
            You know those annoying corner cabinets that you have to crawl into to get anything from? Well this will<br />
            change <u>all</u> of that. With these corner cabinet racks, all you need to do is pull out the rack, and it<br />
            all comes out to greet you. Instead of having wasted cabinet space, you can utilize it with this amazing<br />
            innovation. This is an incredible investment, and you'll be thanking yourself for getting it for years to<br />
            come.
        </p><hr />
        <h2>Containers!</h2>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1577115867-kitchen-containers-1577115859.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=768:*" alt="tupperware" />
        <p>
            Are you sick of having to deal with all the boxes and bags and oddly shaped containers the food you buy <br />
            comes in? This might be an obvious one for some of you, but if it isn't, go out and buy some airtight  <br />
            containers! They're life changers. But warning: make sure to wash them in between uses. They last very  <br />
            well, but you don't want mold growing in your cereal or whatever else is in your container. In the picture<br />
            above, the containers have labels. Not neccessary, but can be helpful.<br /><br />
            You have to be choosy about what you store in these containers. Don't feel pressured to store everything in <br />
            containers. If you have big snack bags that are open, just use bag clips to close them; you don't need to put <br />
            them into a container. You'll have no more room in your pantry!<br />
        </p><hr />
        <h2>Lid Holder</h2>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1566334550-71rsd4isqul-sl1500-1566334514.jpg?crop=0.8xw:1xh;center,top&resize=768:*" alt="lid holder" />
        <p>
            Tupperware containers are great and useful. They're good for lunches, storing leftovers, keeping cut <br />
            veggies... but there's a major downside to these containers: storing them. They come in all different<br />
            shapes and sizes, and storing them and their covers is a nightmare. So this is where the lid organizer<br />
            comes in. It's here to help you deal with the mess and have some organization in your cabinets. Stick this <br />
            into your cabinet and admire the neat stack of cover-less containers. And the last minute rush to find <br />
            the right cover? Gone.
        </p><hr />
        <h2>Pantry Lazy Susan</h2>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1602186948-acacia-wood-turntable-neat-method-1602186839.jpg?crop=0.699xw:0.873xh;0.301xw,0.115xh&resize=768:*" />
        <p>
            While Lazy Susans are meant for food serving, they come in handy in cabinets and pantries. Many people <br />
            use 2 or 3 tiered Lazy Susans to store spices, but you can store other items on them too. These come in<br />
            handy in pantries; instead of having to rifle through everything , you can just twirl the turntable<br />
            and easily get what you need. Major time saver, and anguish saver too!
