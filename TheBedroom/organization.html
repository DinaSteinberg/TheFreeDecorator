    <h1>Organizing Your Room</h1>
    <article>
        <section>
            <p>
                Typical bedroom organizing tips are full of easier-said-than-done advice such as repurposing large furniture<br />
                pieces in an already too-small room or dressing up a room with pretty decor and art without attacking the <br />
                underlying clutter. To create a truly organized—and functional—bedroom, consider every inch of your room,<br />
                including the walls and space under the bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following bedroom organization tips instead focus on cutting clutter, organizing small spaces so they are <br />
                streamlined, and creating a serene vibe in your bedroom. Even better, they can be applied to bedrooms of any size.

            <h3>Under bed storage</h3>
            <p>
                Under the bed storage is great because it is not visible, but still easily accessible. You can choose<br />
                to store just a few items like gift wrap, extra bed sheets, or books in a children's bedroom under<br />
                there. Purchasing a rolling storage container keeps everything organized under the bed, freeing up <br />
                space in your bedroom.

            <h3>Put artwork on the walls</h3>
            <p>
                Especially if you have a small bedroom, put your artwork on the wall and not on your dresser, nightstand,<br />
                or vanity. Keep these spaces clear and your bedroom will have a more streamlined look.
            </p>

            <h3>Organize the room in sections</h3>
            <p>
                Tackling the bedroom all at once can seem overwhelming. Instead, divide the room up based on the function <br />
                of the space. Organize the closet as one project, then move on to armoires, dresser drawers, and wardrobes.<br />
                This way you're decluttering and organizing storage space first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, organize flat areas like the tops of dressers and night tables, as well as any bookcases that may be in<br />
                your bedroom. By leaving the under-the-bed area last, you'll know exactly what can and should be stored there.
            </p>

            <h3>Declutter closets</h3>
            <p>
                Even if your bedroom is spotless, if your closet is spiraling out of control, it will disrupt the calm, serene<br />
                state of the bedroom. Plus, a cluttered closet translates to a longer time getting ready in the morning coupled<br />
                with more frustration getting out the door and to work on time. Reduce the tension by tackling your clothes closet.
                </p>
            <p>
                First, tidy up your closet, either by doing a full closet organization or by doing a quick closet clutter sweep.<br />
                Incorporate a storage system if needed. Once you go through your clothes, donate the unneeded items and revel in<br />
                your newly serene space.

            <h3>Create a functional, clutter free nightstand</h3>
            <p>
                Rather than import a desk, choose a night table that suits your needs while taking up as little space as possible.<br />
                A small dresser where you can store some clothing is a great space-saving trick that many professional organizers<br />
                employ with clients who are living in tight quarters. if you don't have the room for a small dresser, try a slim <br />
                night table with lots of drawers.

            <h3>Have a place for dirty clothes</h3>
            <p>
                A hamper, either in the closet, next to the closet, or near the closet, will help clothes stay contained without<br />
                spilling out all over your bedroom. You can choose one that blends in with your decor, or just use a basic hamper.
            </p>

            <h3>Have a place for trash</h3>
            <p>
                A small attractive garbage pail kept in the bedroom provides you with a spot to throw tissues, scraps of paper,<br />
                and all the other small pieces of trash that make their way into your bedroom. Look for a small bathroom-size<br />
                trash can. Anything larger will be noticeable in a bedroom. The smaller the trash bin, the easier it is to stick<br />
                it under a nightstand or discretely beside a dresser.
            </p>
